# Hangman

## Overview
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence, and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
 
You are given 8 attempts to guess a word that has at least four characters.
This word is randomly selected from a pre-populated list of words. You enter a letter, and the program displays the word guessed so far based on the letters you had entered.
If you enter a letter that is not in the word, your number of guesses is reduced by 1.
If you enter either a letter you had previously entered, a message is displayed to inform you that you had entered this letter earlier, and your number of guesses remains unchanged, and you are to enter a letter again.

If you enter a letter that is in the word, your number of guesses remains unchanged, and you are to enter a letter again. 
At the end of the game, a message is displayed that indicates whether or not you successfully guessed the word.
